# enhanced_Pygments_lexers

Since I am not really happy with [Pygments](https://pygments.org/)' lexical analysis result, and I really could not find another tool that is as easy to use as Pygments, I start this repo for improved code lexing plugins for Pygment users (myself). The improvement is mainly about adding more syntax scopes. For example, arguments in a Python function/method call.  

## Stages of Goals

1. Make this plugin be able to parse as many types of Python elements as Sublime Text editor can.  
2. Wrap it as a extension to Python Markdown module.  
3. Extend improvements to other programming languages that I frequently use (and whose Pygments output I'm not satisfied with)
